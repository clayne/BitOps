# BitOps
Basic, efficient, header-only bit ops and bit array primitives for modern x86. Tests provided.

Simply include `bitops.h` or `bitarray.h` as needed.

Build `bitops_test.cpp`, `bitarray_test.cpp`, and `main.cpp` and run to execute comprehensive tests.

Tested on Windows and Linux, Clang and MSVC. C++17 required. Minor modifications can be made to allow GCC or decrease the language standard requirement.
